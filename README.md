### Hi there! 👋

Hi, I'm Glenn, nice to meet you :)

I have 15+ years of experience in networking, embedded systems development, infrastructure managment & quality automation.
I have also been teaching for over 10+ years.

Since 2010, I co-founded 4 companies related to networked infrastructure (GNUSIDE/NETCAT), open-hardware (42BRICKS), personal data management (DATA TRANSITION), and code quality (BOLDCODE). The last two are still active.

Since the end of 2020 I am also working on the technical aspects of blockchains and writing a book about it. I also address the ethical, social, environmental and political issues that these technologies generate.

If you are also interested in these topics, maybe there are opportunities for collaboration?
